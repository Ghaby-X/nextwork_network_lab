# AWS Networking Lab Series - Complete Implementation üåê

This repository contains my complete implementation of a comprehensive AWS networking series, where I built a secure and scalable Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) architecture from scratch. Through 9 hands-on labs, I gained practical experience with AWS networking fundamentals and best practices.

## Project Overview

I successfully completed all 9 networking labs, building a complete VPC infrastructure with security controls, monitoring, and optimized connectivity. This project demonstrates my understanding of AWS networking concepts and ability to implement production-ready network architectures.

## What I Accomplished

‚úÖ **Built a secure VPC architecture** from the ground up
‚úÖ **Implemented network security** with NACLs and Security Groups
‚úÖ **Connected resources** across different network environments
‚úÖ **Set up network monitoring** with VPC Flow Logs
‚úÖ **Optimized connectivity** using VPC Endpoints and Peering
‚úÖ **Documented the entire process** with screenshots and explanations

## Lab Structure

Each lab folder contains detailed documentation and visual proof of implementation:

### [Lab 1: VPC Foundation](./lab1_vpc/)
- Created the core VPC infrastructure
- Set up public subnets and internet gateway
- Configured route tables for internet connectivity

### [Lab 2: Traffic Flow & Security](./lab2_vpc_flow_and_security/)
- Implemented Network Access Control Lists (NACLs)
- Configured Security Groups for instance-level security
- Established traffic control mechanisms

### [Lab 3: Private Subnet Creation](./lab3_network_private_subnet/)
- Built isolated private subnets
- Associated custom NACLs for enhanced security
- Implemented network segmentation

### [Lab 4: Resource Deployment](./lab4/)
- Launched EC2 instances in public subnets
- Configured instances for network testing
- Set up the foundation for connectivity testing

### [Lab 5: Connectivity Testing](./lab5_testing_connectivity/)
- Verified network communication between resources
- Tested SSH connectivity to instances
- Validated network configuration

### [Lab 6: VPC Peering](./lab6_vpc_peering/)
- Connected multiple VPCs using peering connections
- Configured cross-VPC communication
- Tested private IP connectivity between peered instances

### [Lab 7: Network Monitoring](./lab7_vpc_flow_logs/)
- Implemented VPC Flow Logs for traffic analysis
- Set up network monitoring and logging
- Configured log analysis for security insights

### [Lab 8: S3 Integration](./lab8_s3_access/)
- Connected VPC resources to S3 storage services
- Configured secure access to AWS storage
- Implemented data transfer workflows

### [Lab 9: VPC Endpoints](./lab9_creation_of_vpc_endpoint/)
- Created VPC Endpoints for optimized AWS service connectivity
- Reduced data transfer costs and improved security
- Implemented private connectivity to AWS services

## Technical Skills Demonstrated
