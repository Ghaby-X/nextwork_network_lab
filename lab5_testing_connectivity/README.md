# Lab 5: VPC Connectivity Testing - Complete Implementation

## Overview

This lab demonstrates successful network connectivity validation within the VPC infrastructure. I performed comprehensive testing to verify that all network components function correctly and securely.

## What I Accomplished

✅ **Verified SSH connectivity** to EC2 instances
✅ **Tested network communication** between resources
✅ **Validated security group rules** in practice
✅ **Confirmed internet connectivity** through IGW
